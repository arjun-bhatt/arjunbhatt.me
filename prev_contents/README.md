your repo should include a README.md file with:
a couple sentence description of what you did and what worked / didnâ€™t work.
screen caps of your layout stage
screen caps with anything special you want to point out
url to the original landing page you were mimicking

I wayyyyy underestimated how long this would take. Rookie move, I know. I was trying to copy notion.so, but realized that this was a very long webpage so I just got as far as I could go. I have images that change color when you hover over them, a working mailto: link, a google forms embedding, another html form that I'm honestly not thrilled with (it gives you a dialog box if you click it). I have a nav bar with a login button that changes color on hover, a dropdown menu on my second nav bar (I get lost easily). The icons and the big image both resize with the webpage. I had to resort to using a shadow effect because apparently there's not a way to make a text outline, which I wasn't impressed by. (If you know a way, please show me the way.)


My layout screencaps are here: https://imgur.com/a/KVHOYvP
(My .md file opened in a text editor, so I wasn't sure how to put images directly here.)
