The modal was a pain to get working. I learned a bit about javascript through this assignment, and now feel comfortable having things happen when you click buttons. I also feel comfortable with CSS. I think a big part of the difficulty comes with pasting code from elsewhere that doesn't fit into the structure I had beforehand, and because I don't initially understand what I paste I can't really reconcile the two. I did plan my webpage out ahead of time though, so that's why the HTML is much more logical this time around.
